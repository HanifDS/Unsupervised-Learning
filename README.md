# Unsupervised-Learning
I used a public dataset from Kaggle to cluster the countries using socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country.  The goal was to cluster using unsupervised learning, to infer based on correlations observed and to then cross reference these observations with academic literature. 

I used Kmeans to cluster the data. 
I then used python libraries: Pandas to analyse the data, Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualise it.

Attached also is a powerpoint with some of the observations.
